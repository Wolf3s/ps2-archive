gsKit ChangeLog:

-> 05/19/06 - Chris Gilbert (Neovanglist)
   * Added gsKit_prim_sprite_striped_texture. This routine autostrips
     sprites for a big performance boost. This is most useful on large
     sprites which would otherwise result in many GS pagemisses.
     NOTE: This ONLY works with textures that have NEAREST filtering.
   * Reworked drawbuffers so that it waits on the FINISH signal from the GS
     before pushing new DMA to it.
   * Added "bigtex" example.
   * Added option to delay texture uploading. This allows you to do it manually
     using the gsKit_texture_send_inline in usercode.

-> 04/22/06 - Chris Gilbert (Neovanglist)
   * Fully implimented FONTM support.
   * Added a hack on 4bit BMP textures to swap nibbles so it displays
     correctly.
   * Added a gsKit_texture_send_inline routine, this allows you to schedule
     a texture upload via your drawbuffer.
     *WARNING* You MUST make ensure that when the time comes to send, the
     cache is in sync since it won't FlushCache() for you. The best way
     to do this is to write the texture to be uploaded in memory using UCAB.
   * Added a gsKit_heap_alloc_dma routine. This allows you to allocate things
     with their own DMA_TAGs into the drawbuffer. (Like textures)

-> 04/15/06 - Chris Gilbert (Neovanglist)
   * Added 4bit BMP image support.
   * Started on FONTM support - added fontm example

-> 04/14/06 - Chris Gilbert (Neovanglist)
   * More big changes to the drawbuffer system...
   * gsKit is now working 100% as far as I know, please report bugs ASAP.
   * gsKit is now the fastest library according to Shazz's "newlibtest" - 27800 tri/frame!
   * NOTICE: Made some dmaKit changes, cleaned up the API a bit and added a new
     specialized routine. If you use dmaKit, you will need to make some trivial
     changes to get it compiling. (Just remove the timeout argument from your call.)
   * Added TIFF texture support to gsKit (and ported libtiff, will be in svn soon)
   * Added full (and fixed) Alpha blending support, check the alpha example.
   * Other small stuff here and there.
   * gsKit 0.3 release is on it's way very soon, please let me know of any bugs
     and/or last minute features ASAP so I can get them into the release.
   * Added a 512 byte dma_misc buffer to gsGlobal. This is for small/trivial
     DMA packets so you don't have to memalign() for them.
     NOTE: It's UCAB, so be careful how you work with it.

-> 04/09/06 - Chris Gilbert (Neovanglist)
   * Totally overhauled the drawbuffer system... (again)
   * gsKit now uses REGLIST mode and GIFTAG sharing on same-type prims!
   * Major speedups.
   * Got all known bugs back out... last commit was a real mess.
   * NOTICE: I made new routines in gsCore for setting tex1 and blend modes. 
     Right now they get setup "Automagically" but this is a performance issue
     and will be changed *after* gsKit 0.3.

-> 02/06/06 - Chris Gilbert (Neovanglist)
   * Fixed some bugs in relation to SPR/drawpipe management
   * Some small optimizations

-> 02/05/06 - Chris Gilbert (Neovanglist)
   * Removed gsKit_scale for good.
   * Overhauled the drawbuffer objects, and how persistant drawpipes are handled.
   * Implimented custom SPR allocator and handler for gsKit.
   * Fixed misc bugs along the way.
   * Removed immediate mode.
   * More misc optimizations.

-> 01/16/06 - Chris Gilbert (Neovanglist)
   * More optimizations!
   * Now using the scratchpad more intensively duing renderlist building.
   * Packed the Element structure more tightly, and made it an aligned non-pointer array in the Queue.
   * NOTICE: Modified the GS_AXIS_ macros so that X, U, and V are the same value, so I only have to check on one in gsKit_scale. (Better performance)

-> 01/15/06 - Chris Gilbert (Neovanglist)
   * Tons of optimizations!
   * Now using toSPR as well as fromSPR.
   * Fixed some other misc bugs.

-> 01/14/06 - Chris Gilbert (Neovanglist)
   * Implimented the long awaited gsKit render queue!
   * Implimented DMA fromSPR into dmaKit.
   * Optimzied examples to take advantage of the rew render queue.

-> 01/12/06 - Chris Gilbert (Neovanglist)
   * Fixed large-size textures bug.
   * Modified texture_send to check the dma chain size and only use spr if room is avail.

-> 01/12/06 - Chris Gilbert (Neovanglist)
   * Fixed missing lines of texture bug.
   * Fixed some issues in regards to halfbuffers.

-> 01/12/06 - Chris Gilbert (Neovanglist)
   * Big commit - fixed many bugs!
   * HalfBuffers working now in PAL and NTSC

-> 03/12/04 - linuzappz
   * Fixed FNT format support.
   * FNT files can be loaded in raw format.
   * font demo uses arial.fnt by default, compiled within the elf.

-> 06/29/04 - Chris Gilbert (Neovanglist) 
   * dmaKit officially finished.
   * gsKit has working ZTest.
   * gsKit has working Alpha.
   * All primitives implimented and working.
   * gsKit 0.1 release.

-> 06/15/04 - Chris Gilbert (Neovanglist) 
   * Changed directory layout. (See README)
   * Added dmaKit.

-> 06/15/04 - Chris Gilbert (Neovanglist) 
   * Project framework and build system completed.
   * Created CVS module and commited to PS2Dev CVS.
   * README, STATUS, AUTHORS, ID, and LICENSE files added.
