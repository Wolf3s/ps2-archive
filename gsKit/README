 Introduction
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

 gsKit is a library that provides a C interface to the Playstation 2
 Graphics Synthesizer. It is low level in nature, implimented using the
 PS2SDK and inline assembly. This project does not aim to be all
 inclusive, rather a "lean and mean" interface to the GS hardware.

 The following list is of things that, when complete, gsKit will be capable
 of when it reaches it's mature stages. It is currently in the early
 stages of development. Read the STATUS file for detailed information.

 gsKit aims to provide the following functionality:
 
 - Multi format GS initialization. (NTSC, PAL, DTV, VESA)
 - HalfBuffer Support (NTSC_I and PAL_I modes)
 - VSync, Double Buffering, Anti Aliasing, and Z Depth Test.
 - Dynamic Render Queue Support, with different drawing modes. (GS_IMMEDIATE, GS_ONESHOT, and GS_PERSISTANT)
 - Overlay and multi-context support utilizing the "Merge Circuit".
 - Basic primitives as per the Sony documentation. (Line, Tri, TriStrip, ...)
 - Extended primitives support. (Quads and GL Style Vertex Lists)
 - Simple texture loading and handling.
 - Font and printing support for FNT and TrueType formats.
 - GS debugging and diagnostic functionality.
 - C accessibility of all documented GS instructions.

 gsKit also includes a library named dmaKit. dmaKit provides C 
 routines for DMAC usage by gsKit. The aim of this library is also
 for eventual inclusion in PS2SDK. For now, it will remain part of the
 gsKit project while it matures.

 This library is designed for intergration into the PS2SDK when it 
 becomes mature. As such, it is also designed to link and compile
 against the PS2SDK. Support for PS2LIB and other support libraries is
 untested.
