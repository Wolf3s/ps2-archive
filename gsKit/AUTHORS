People that I'd like to thank, and why:

emoon - For the BreakPoint Demo Lib, which I have used *so* much code from, and 
	based a large portion of my learning on. Without this, gsKit would not have
	been possible.

ooPo - For research, documentation, and reference implimentations for the DMAC and GS.

t0mb0la - For several bugfixes, suggestions, and support.

Drakonite - Bug fixes, misc. help, and support.

linuzappz - First working implimentation for texture support, other code contributions.

And everyone else from the PS2 Dev community! Thanks!
