A few quick notes about the implementation of ps2sdk SDL audio.

* I chose to use isjPCM for the time being. It works fine, and with
time, I will put my own IRX here, which suits SDL needs better. You
are required to precompile and install isjPCM beforehand.

* Only 48000 hz, 16 bit stereo waves are supported. Anything else will
fail. There is an option in SDL to automagically convert samples on the
fly, but I couldn't get it to work.

* DEMUXing of LR stereo is done on EE side.

This is a work in progress. I am constantly updating and releasing 
my source tree, to let everyone catch up with the latest changes. If you
have any comments, please contact me. I will be thankful for some peer 
code reviews.

* I have been informed of problems with isjPCM 2.2, and isjPCM 2.1 is known
to work; you have been warned.
